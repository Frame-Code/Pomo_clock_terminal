### How to test it
1. Download the executable in this link [Click here](https://github.com/Frame-Code/Pomo_clock_t1erminal/releases/download/v1.0/clock_app.jar)

2. Execute the jar file using the terminal: 
`$ java -jar <jar_file_name> <time_minutes_pomodoro> <total_pomodoros> <time_minutes_rest> "some title of task" `
E.g: A pomodoro of 25 minutes, 4 cicles and 5 minutes of rest (assuming it is in the folder where the jar file is located):
`$ java -jar  clock_app 25 4 5 "Study design_patterns" `

Also is possible create a bat file to execute the jar file (asssuming the jar file is located in a unique place) and add the bat file on the path of envionment variables :D
